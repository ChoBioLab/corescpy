    "The `crispr.Crispr()` class is the main way of interacting with the package; however, if you want to manipulate a data object before subjecting it to the initial processing steps in the `Crispr.__init__` method for some reason, you can use `adata = cr.pp.create_object(file_path, ...)`, then pass `adata` to the class initialization method in lieu of a file/dictionary of file processing arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u> Argument Conventions: </u>\n",
    "\n",
    "Certain arguments used throughout the `crispr` package (including outside the `crispr.crispr_class.Crispr()` class), hold to conventions intended to foster readability, maintain consistency, and promote clarity, both for end-users and future developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use the `copy` argument to avoid altering internal attributes (including `.adata`) in most `Crispr` class methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Arguments starting in `col_` and `key_`\n",
    "    - The \"col_\" prefix indicates that an argument refers to a column name (often in `.adata.obs` or `.adata.var`), while the \"key_\" prefix means you're meant to specify a type of entry in a column. For instance, assume the column \"condition\" contains the names of different experimental conditions (drug A, drug B, drug C). In a function where you want to compare, for instance, drug A vs. control, you would specify `key_treatment=\"drug A\"` and k\n",
    "    - These names may \n",
    "        * already exist (or will exist in the `.adata` attribute immediately upon creating the AnnData object from the data file) or \n",
    "        * may yet to be created, namely, after object initialization by running the object's methods. Thus, you may specify what you want certain columns to be named (e.g., the binary perturbed/non-perturbed column) or what entries within a column will be called (e.g., \"Control\" for rows within the `col_control` corresponding to cells that have control guide RNA IDs in `col_guide_rna`), for aesthetics, customizability to your design/interpretability, and/or to avoid duplicating pre-existing names.\n",
    "    - These arguments will be entered as items (with the argument names as keys) in dictionaries stored in the object attributes `._columns` and `._keys`, respectively.\n",
    "    - These arguments will often be passed by default (or will force them as specifications) to various object methods.\n",
    "    - In certain methods, you can specify a new column to use just for that function. For instance, if you have a column containing CellTypist annotations and want to use those clusters instead of the \"leiden\" ones for the `run_dialogue()` method, you can specify in that method (`run_dialogue(col_cell_type=\"majority_voting\")`) without changing the attribute (`self._columns`) that contains your original specification here.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- break -->\n",
    "\n",
    "* `col_perturbed` (binary) vs. `col_condition` (can have >= 3 categories)\n",
    "    - In the `Crispr` class object, `col_perturbed` is meant to be a binary column that has `key_control` as the entry for control rows and `key_treatment` for all other experimental conditions. \n",
    "        * For instance, for a CRISPR design targeting more than one gene, `col_perturbed` would contain only `key_treatment` (i.e., all perturbed cells, regardless of targeted gene) while `col_condition` would contain entries specifying the particular gene(s) targeted (or `key_control`).\n",
    "        * A drug design targeting more than one gene, `col_perturbed` would contain only `key_treatment` (i.e., all perturbed cells, regardless of targeted gene) while `col_condition` would contain entries specifying the particular gene(s) targeted (or `key_control`).\n",
    "        * If the design only targets one gene/has one treatment conditions/etc., these columns would simply be equivalent.\n",
    "    - In the `Crispr` class object, it is created during object initialization as a column (named after your specification of `col_perturbed`) in `.obs`. All rows in `.obs[col_condition]` that do not = `key_control` will be set as `key_treatment`.\n",
    "    - In the `crispr` package more broadly, if a function calls for a `col_perturbed` argument, that indicates that it works with binary categories only. If it is fed a column with three or more categories, it will either subset the data to include only rows where that column = `key_treatment` or `key_control` (desirable behavior if you want to compare only a subset of the existing conditions, but undesirable if you want to look at, say, any drug vs. control, where the desired \"drug\" category consists of rows where the column = \"drug A\" and \"drug B\"), or it will throw an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Initialization Method Arguments (Select)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of the important argument for the `Crispr()` class initialization method:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `file_path`: Path or object containing data. Used in initialization to create the initial `self.adata` attribute (an AnnData or MuData object). Either\n",
    "    - a path to a 10x directory (with matrix.mtx.gz, barcodes.tsv.gz, features.tsv.gz),\n",
    "    - a path to an .h5ad or .mu file (Scanpy/AnnData/Muon-compatible), \n",
    "    - an AnnData or MuData object (e.g., already loaded with Scanpy or Muon, or by using `crispr.pp.create_object(file_path)`), or\n",
    "    - a dictionary containing keyword arguments to pass to  `crispr.pp.combine_matrix_protospacer()` (in order to load information about perturbations from other file(s); see function documentation), or\n",
    "    - to concatenate multiple datasets, a dictionary (keyed by your desired subject/sample names to be used in `col_sample_id`) consisting of whatever objects you would pass to `create_object()`'s `file` argument for the individual objects. You must also specify `col_sample` (a tuple as described in the documentation below). The other arguments passed to the `crispr.pp.create_object()` function (e.g., `col_gene_symbols`) can be specified as normal if they are common across samples; otherwise, specify them as lists in the same order as the `file` dictionary. \n",
    "* `col_sample_id`: Column in `.obs` with sample IDs. If this column does not yet exist in your data and needs to be created by concatenating datasets, you must provide\n",
    "    - `file_path` as a dictionary keyed by desired `col_sample_id` values as well as \n",
    "    - signal that concatenation needs to happen by specifying `col_sample_id` as a tuple, with the second element containing a dictionary of keyword arguments to pass to `AnnData.concatenate()` or None (to use defaults).\n",
    "\n",
    "See docstring in `crispr.crispr_object` and the README for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Crispr Object Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are descriptions of major `Crispr()` object attributes and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "* `.adata`: AnnData object. Columns or other objects created in the course of running certain methods may also be stored in its various attributes. Below are listed some of the major attributes of `.adata`. Note that for multi-modal data (self._assay is not None), some of these attributes may need to be accessed by `.adata[self._assay].<attribute>`, but for brevity, we'll refer to `.adata` here. Not all will/have to be present, except `.X`, `.obs`, and `.var`. You can access the gene expression modality directly by calling `self.rna`, whether the data are multi- or single-modal.\n",
    "    -  `.X`: Sparse matrix of data originally passed to the function to create an AnnData object (e.g., from CellRanger output).\n",
    "    -  `.layers`: Contains different versions of `adata.X`, such as scaled data (`adata.layers[\"scaled\"]`) or that created by calculating a \n",
    "                  Mixscape perturbation signature (`adata.layers[\"X_pert\"]`, by default).\n",
    "    -  `.obs`: pandas.DataFrame of observations (rows=cells). You can store additional data about individual cells/samples/etc. here by assigning a new column. Can also be called directly using `self.obs`.\n",
    "    -  `.obsm`: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n",
    "    -  `.obsm`: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n",
    "    -  `.var`: pandas.DataFrame of observations (rows=cells). You can store additional data about individual cells/samples/etc. here by assigning a new column. \n",
    "            Often contains the gene symbols and EnsemblIDs (either of which is often the index/`.var_names`),\n",
    "            \"feature_types\" (e.g., \"Gene Expression\"), and, after preprocessing, may contain columns such as the number of cells expressing that feature (\"n_cells\"),\n",
    "            whether that feature is a mitochonrial (\"mt\") and/or highly variable (\"highly_variable\") gene, mean and total counts, percent dropout, means, dispersions, \n",
    "            and normalized versions of these metrics. Can also be called directly using `self.var`.\n",
    "    -  `.uns`: A dictionary that holds various results and other information. Can also be called directly using `self.uns`.\n",
    "    -  `.obs_names`: Row indices of `.obs` (e.g., cell barcodes). Changing this attribute changes this index, and has other potential benefits/consequences.\n",
    "    -  `.var_names`: Row indices of `.var` (i.e., gene names). Changing this attribute changes this index, and has other potential benefits/consequences.\n",
    "    -  `.n_obs`: Number of observations (i.e., cells).\n",
    "    -  `.n_vars`: Number of features (i.e., genes/proteins/etc.).\n",
    "* `.results`: Stored output (other than figures). Note that some results may also be saved in `.obs` and `.uns` attributes of `.adata`.\n",
    "* `.figures`: Stored figure objects.\n",
    "* `.info`: Miscellaneous information about the object (e.g., its analysis/processing history).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the methods (applicable to scRNA-seq generally, not just perturbations) **in order** of a typical workflow _(replace ... with argument specifications)_:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `self.preprocess(...)`: Perform filtering, normalization, scaling, quality control analysis, selection for highly variable genes, regressing out confounds, and intial exploration of the data (e.g., cell counts, mitochondrial counts, etc.).\n",
    "* `self.cluster(...)`: Perform dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA) and clustering (Louvain or Leiden), as well as related visualization.\n",
    "* `self.plot(...)`: Create additional basic plots (e.g., dot, matrix, and violin gene expression plots).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following perturbation-specific methods can be executed optionally and in any order:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `self.run_augur(...)`: Score and plot how strongly different cell types responded to perturbation(s). This score is operationalized as the accuracy with which a machine learning model can use gene expression data to predict the perturbation condition to which cells of a given type belong. Augur provides scores aggregated across cells of a given type rather than for individual cells.\n",
    "* `self.run_mixscape(...)`: Quantify and plot the extent to which individual cells responded to CRISPR perturbation(s), and identify which perturbation condition cells were not detectibly perturbed in terms of their gene expression.\n",
    "* `self.compute_distance(...)`: Calculate and visualize various distance metrics that quantify the similarity in gene expression profiles across perturbation conditions.\n",
    "* `self.run_composition_analysis(...)`: Analyze and visualize shifts in the cell type composition across perturbation conditions.\n",
    "* `self.run_dialogue(...)`: Create plots showing multi-cellular programs."
