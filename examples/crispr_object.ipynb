    "<u> Argument Conventions: </u>\n",
    "\n",
    "Certain arguments used throughout the `crispr` package (including outside the `crispr.crispr_class.Crispr()` class), hold to conventions intended to foster readability, maintain consistency, and promote clarity, both for end-users and future developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Arguments starting in `col_` and `key_`\n",
    "    - The \"col_\" prefix indicates that an argument refers to a column name (often in `.adata.obs` or `.adata.var`), while the \"key_\" prefix means you're meant to specify a type of entry in a column. For instance, assume the column \"condition\" contains the names of different experimental conditions (drug A, drug B, drug C). In a function where you want to compare, for instance, drug A vs. control, you would specify `key_treatment=\"drug A\"` and k\n",
    "    - These names may \n",
    "        * already exist (or will exist in the `.adata` attribute immediately upon creating the AnnData object from the data file) or \n",
    "        * may yet to be created, namely, after object initialization by running the object's methods. Thus, you may specify what you want certain columns to be named (e.g., the binary perturbed/non-perturbed column) or what entries within a column will be called (e.g., \"Control\" for rows within the `col_control` corresponding to cells that have control guide RNA IDs in `col_guide_rna`), for aesthetics, customizability to your design/interpretability, and/or to avoid duplicating pre-existing names.\n",
    "    - These arguments will be entered as items (with the argument names as keys) in dictionaries stored in the object attributes `._columns` and `._keys`, respectively.\n",
    "    - These arguments will often be passed by default (or will force them as specifications) to various object methods.\n",
    "    - In certain methods, you can specify a new column to use just for that function. For instance, if you have a column containing CellTypist annotations and want to use those clusters instead of the \"leiden\" ones for the `run_dialogue()` method, you can specify in that method (`run_dialogue(col_cell_type=\"majority_voting\")`) without changing the attribute (`self._columns`) that contains your original specification here.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- break -->\n",
    "\n",
    "* `col_perturbed` (binary) vs. `col_condition` (can have >= 3 categories)\n",
    "    - In the `Crispr` class object, `col_perturbed` is meant to be a binary column that has `key_control` as the entry for control rows and `key_treatment` for all other experimental conditions. \n",
    "        * For instance, for a CRISPR design targeting more than one gene, `col_perturbed` would contain only `key_treatment` (i.e., all perturbed cells, regardless of targeted gene) while `col_condition` would contain entries specifying the particular gene(s) targeted (or `key_control`).\n",
    "        * A drug design targeting more than one gene, `col_perturbed` would contain only `key_treatment` (i.e., all perturbed cells, regardless of targeted gene) while `col_condition` would contain entries specifying the particular gene(s) targeted (or `key_control`).\n",
    "        * If the design only targets one gene/has one treatment conditions/etc., these columns would simply be equivalent.\n",
    "    - In the `Crispr` class object, it is created during object initialization as a column (named after your specification of `col_perturbed`) in `.obs`. All rows in `.obs[col_condition]` that do not = `key_control` will be set as `key_treatment`.\n",
    "    - In the `crispr` package more broadly, if a function calls for a `col_perturbed` argument, that indicates that it works with binary categories only. If it is fed a column with three or more categories, it will either subset the data to include only rows where that column = `key_treatment` or `key_control` (desirable behavior if you want to compare only a subset of the existing conditions, but undesirable if you want to look at, say, any drug vs. control, where the desired \"drug\" category consists of rows where the column = \"drug A\" and \"drug B\"), or it will throw an error.\n",

    "* `file_path` **(str, AnnData, or dictionary)**: Path or object containing data. Used in initialization to create the initial `self.adata` attribute (an AnnData or MuData object). Either\n",
    "    - a path to a 10x directory (with matrix.mtx.gz, barcodes.tsv.gz, features.tsv.gz),\n",
    "    - a path to an .h5ad or .mu file (Scanpy/AnnData/Muon-compatible), \n",
    "    - an AnnData or MuData object (e.g., already loaded with Scanpy or Muon), or\n",
    "    - a dictionary containing keyword arguments to pass to  `crispr.pp.combine_matrix_protospacer()` (in order to load information about perturbations from other file(s); see function documentation).\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- break -->\n",
    "\n",
    "* `assay` **(str, optional)**: Name of the gene expression assay if loading a multi-modal data object (e.g., \"rna\"). Defaults to None (i.e., `self.adata` is single-modal).\n",
    "\n",
    "* `assay_protein` **(str, optional)**: Name of the assay containing the protein expression modality, if available. For instance, if \"adt\", `self.adata[\"adt\"]` would be expected to contain the AnnData object for the protein modality. ONLY FOR MULTI-MODAL DATA for certain bonus visualization methods. Defaults to None.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `col_gene_symbols` **(str, optional)**: Column name in `.var` for gene symbols. Defaults to \"gene_symbols\".\n",
    "\n",
    "* `col_cell_type` **(str, optional)**: Column name in `.obs` for cell type. Defaults to \"leiden\" (anticipating that you will run `self.cluster(...)` with `method_cluster=\"leiden\"`). This column may be\n",
    "    - pre-existing in data (e.g., pre-run clustering column or manual annotations), or \n",
    "    - expected to be created via `Crispr.cluster()`. \n",
    "\n",

    "* `col_batch` **(str, optional)**: Column in `.obs` with batch IDs. Defaults to None.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `col_condition` **(str, optional)**: Either the name of an existing column in `.obs` indicating the experimental condition to which each cell belongs or (for CRISPR designs) the **desired** name of the column that will be created from `col_guide_rna` to indicate the gene(s) targeted in each cell.\n",
    "    - If there are multiple conditions besides control (e.g., multiple types of drugs and/or exposure times, multiple target genes in CRISPR), this column distinguishes the different conditions, in contrast to `col_perturbed` (a binary treated/perturbed vs. control indicator). \n",
    "    - In CRISPR designs (i.e., when `col_guide_rna` is specified), this column will be where each guide RNA's target gene will be stored, whether pre-existing (copied directly from `col_guide_rna` if `kws_process_guide_rna` is None) or created during the Crispr object initialization by passing `col_guide_rna` and `kws_process_guide_rna` to `crispr.pp.filter_by_guide_counts()` in order to convert particular guide RNA IDs to their target(s) (e.g., STAT1-1|CCL8-2-1|NegCtrl32a => STAT1|CCL8|Control). Defaults to None.\n",
    "    - For non-CRISPR designs (e.g., pharmacological treatment):\n",
    "        - This column should exist in the AnnData or MuData object (either already available upon simply reading the specified file with no other alterations, or as originally passed to the initialization method if given instead of a file path).\n",
    "        - It should contain a single `key_control`, but it can have multiple categories of other entries that all translate to `key_treatment` in `col_perturbed`.\n",
    "        - If you have multiple control conditions, you should pass an already-created AnnData object to the `file_path` argument of the `Crispr` class initialization method after adding a separate column with a name different from those specified in any of the other column arguments. You can then pass that column name manually to certain functions' `col_control` arguments and specify the particular control condition in `key_control`.\n",
    "    - In most methods, `key_control` and `key_treatment`, as well as `col_perturbed` or `col_condition` (for methods that don't require binary labeling), can be newly-specified so that you can compare different conditions within this column. If the argument is named `col_perturbed`, passing a column with more than two categories usually results in subsetting the data to compare only the two conditions specified in `key_treatment` and `key_control`. The exception is where there is a `key_treatment_list` or similarly-named argument.\n",

    "* `col_perturbed` **(str, optional)**: Column in `.obs` where class methods will be able to find the binary experimental condition variable. It will be created during `Crispr` object initialization as a binary version of `col_condition`. Defaults to \"perturbation\". For CRISPR designs, all entries containing the patterns specified in `kws_process_guide_rna[\"key_control_patterns\"]` will be changed to `key_control`, and all cells with targeting guides will be changed to `key_treatment`.\n",

    "    - If only one kind of guide RNA is used, then this should be a column containing the name of the gene targeted (for perturbed cells) and the names of any controls, and `key_treatment` should be the name of the gene targeted. Then, `col_condition` will be a direct copy of this column.\n",
    "    - Entries in this column should be either gene names in `self.adata.var_names` (or `key_control` or one of the patterns in `kws_process_guide_rna[\"key_control_patterns\"]`), plus, optionally, suffixes separating guide #s (e.g., STAT1-1-2, CTRL-1) and/or with a character that splits separate guide RNAs within that cell (if multiply-transfected cells are present). These characters should be specified in `kws_process_guide_rna[\"guide_split\"]` and `kws_process_guide_rna[\"feature_split\"]`, respectively. For instance, they would be \"-\" and \"|\", if `col_guide_rna` entries for a cell multiply transfected by two sgRNAs targeting STAT1, two control guide RNAs, and a guide targeting CCL5  would look like \"STAT1-1-1|STAT1-1-2|CNTRL-1-1|CCL5-1\".\n",
    "    - Currently, everything after the first dash (or whatever split character is specified) is discarded when creating `col_target_genes`, so keep that in mind.\n",
    "    - This column will be stored as `<col_guide_rna>_original` if `kws_process_guide_rna` is not None, as that will result in a processed version of this column being stored under `self.adata.obs[<col_guide_rna>]`.\n",

    "* `col_num_umis` **(str, optional)**: Name of column in `.obs` with the UMI counts. This should be specified if `kws_process_guide_rna` is not None. For designs with multiply-transfected cells, it should follow the same convention established in `kws_process_guide_rna[\"feature_split\"]`. Defaults to \"num_umis\".\n",
    "\n",
    "* `key_control` **(str, optional)**: The label that is or will be in `col_condition`, `col_guide_rna`, and `col_perturbed` indicating control rows. Defaults to \"NT\". Either \n",
    "    - exists as entries in pre-existing column(s), or\n",
    "    - is the name you want the control entries (detected using `.obs[<col_guide_rna>]` and `kws_process_guide_rna[\"key_control_patterns\"]`) to be categorized as control rows under the new version(s) of `.obs[<col_guide_rna>]`, `.obs[<col_target_genes>]`, and/or `.obs[<col_perturbed>]`. For instance, entries like \"CNTRL-1\", \"NEGCNTRL\", \"Control\", etc. in `col_guide_rna` would all be keyed as \"Control\" in (the new versions of) `col_target_genes`, `col_guide_rna`, and `col_perturbed` if you specify `key_control=\"Control` and `kws_process_guide_rna=dict(key_control_patterns=[\"CTRL\", \"Control\"])`. \n",

    "* `kws_process_guide_rna` (dict, optional): Dictionary of keyword arguments to pass to `crispr.pp.filter_by_guide_counts()`. (See below and crispr.processing.preprocessing documentation). Defaults to None (no processing will take place, in which case BE SURE THAT `col_target_genes` already exists in the data once loaded and contains the already-filtered, summed up, generic gene-named, etc. versions of the guide RNA column). Keys of this dictionary should be:\n",
    "    - key_control_patterns (list, optional): List (or single string) of patterns in guide RNA column entries that correspond to a control. For instance, if control entries in the original `col_guide_rna` column include `NEGCNTRL` and `Control.D`, you should specify ['Control', 'CNTRL'] (assuming no non-control sgRNA names contain those patterns). If blank entries should be interpreted as control guides, then include np.nan/numpy.nan in this list. Defaults to None, which turns to [np.nan].\n",

    "* `.adata`: AnnData object. Columns or other objects created in the course of running certain methods may also be stored in its various attributes. Below are listed some of the major attributes of `.adata`. Note that for multi-modal data (self._assay is not None), some of these attributes may need to be accessed by `.adata[self._assay].<attribute>`, but for brevity, we'll refer to `.adata` here. Not all will/have to be present, except `.X`, `.obs`, and `.var`.\n",
    "    -  `.X`: Sparse matrix of data originally passed to the function to create an AnnData object (e.g., from CellRanger output).\n",

    "Similarly, you can access the `.obs` attribute of your AnnData using `self.adata.obs` directly, or simply `self.obs`. The same holds true for `.var`, `.uns`, and `.obsm`, except that while `self.obs` for multi-modal objects holds the overall `.obs` attribute (with prefixes by assay on the column names, e.g., rna:num_umis, adt:num_umis), the others listed call the gene expression modality attribute directly (e.g., `self.adata[self._assay].uns`).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have multi-modal data in `self.adata`, it's convenient to access the `.obs` attribute specifically of your AnnData's gene expression modality using the alias `self.rna.obs` instead of the long-form `self.adata[self._assay].obs`.\n",
    "\n",
    "These aliases are not only convenient for their brevity, but also allow for a more generalizable way to call specific objects. For instance, if you wanted to write a script that frequently calls the `.obs` attribute of the RNA data, and you want it to work for both uni- and multi-modal data, instead of repeatedly writing, for example:\n",

    "    custom_function(self.adata[self._assay].obs)\n",
    "```\n",
    "you may simply say `self.obs.rna`, knowing it will work whether or not multiple assays exist in the object's AnnData attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, this approach saves memory: All these versions of the attribute are stored in a single place in memory so you can call the attributes in various ways without duplicating them and taking up more space.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Major Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the methods (applicable to scRNA-seq generally, not just perturbations) **in order** of a typical workflow _(replace ... with argument specifications)_:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `self.preprocess(...)`: Perform filtering, normalization, scaling, quality control analysis, selection for highly variable genes, regressing out confounds, and intial exploration of the data (e.g., cell counts, mitochondrial counts, etc.).\n",
    "* `self.cluster(...)`: Perform dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA) and clustering (Louvain or Leiden), as well as related visualization.\n",
    "* `self.plot(...)`: Create additional basic plots (e.g., dot, matrix, and violin gene expression plots).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following perturbation-specific methods can be executed optionally and in any order:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `self.run_augur(...)`: Score and plot how strongly different cell types responded to perturbation(s). This score is operationalized as the accuracy with which a machine learning model can use gene expression data to predict the perturbation condition to which cells of a given type belong. Augur provides scores aggregated across cells of a given type rather than for individual cells.\n",
    "* `self.run_mixscape(...)`: Quantify and plot the extent to which individual cells responded to CRISPR perturbation(s), and identify which perturbation condition cells were not detectibly perturbed in terms of their gene expression.\n",
    "* `self.compute_distance(...)`: Calculate and visualize various distance metrics that quantify the similarity in gene expression profiles across perturbation conditions.\n",
    "* `self.run_composition_analysis(...)`: Analyze and visualize shifts in the cell type composition across perturbation conditions.\n",
    "* `self.run_dialogue(...)`: Create plots showing multi-cellular programs."

    "\n",
    "End users can simply pass to the `file` argument of `Crispr()` a 10x CellRanger output directory (or a dictionary of appropriate protospacer-related arguments if perturbation-related data aren't included in the .mtx file; see the `Crispr.preprocessing.combine_matrix_protospacer()` function for details) or .h5ad file if desired.\n",
